### Basic Usages

After downloading the template, you can simply edit the HTML and CSS files from the `theme` folder. To preview the changes you make to the code, you can open the index.html file in your web browser.

### Advanced Usage

#### Install prerequisites (once for a machine)

* **Node Installation:** [Install node js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* **Gulp Installation:** Install gulp globally from your terminal

```
npm install --global gulp-cli
```

Or visit the original [Gulp docs](https://gulpjs.com/docs/en/getting-started/quick-start)

#### Local setup
